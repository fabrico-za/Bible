Introduction
------------

All things that are good are from God.

We would greatly appreciate fellow Kingdom citizens to assist regarding any and all matters regarding this project.

We, as God fearing Christians, thank God, for the privilege and ability to read His Word.
Knowing that we will not find everlasting life in the scriptures, but only through the Messiah, Jesus Christ, the Way, the Truth and the Life –John 5: 39; John 14: 6.

We thank the community of translators, publishing companies, and Johannes Guttenberg for starting of the printing of the Bible. We greatly admire the work that they have done. We thank the inventors of the technologies, that we are using and that we are about to use to expand God's Kingdom. We will do our best to continue your good work for the Glory of God.

This project's purpose is not to financially profit the contributors, but to give freely as we receive God's love underserved. We aim to give free access to the best software that the Christian Community can provide, to all that are willing to participate.

"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear" - Jesus - Matthew 11: 15 KJV | John 5: 24 {Add additional references}

### A note to translators and publishers:

We are confident in stating that no company or individual person can claim authorship on the Word of God, unless that company or person is God Himself, therefore we do not pertain to copyright claims and we will not be interested in explaining the motivation of this project to such parties making copyright claims. 

As God is not a respector of persons (Acts 10: 34), we will abide in doing the work that He has set before us.

(We don't expect you to give away the printed copies of the Bible's published by your company for free. We are aware of the costs of printing. Find comfort in the fact that [batteries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battery_types) do not last forever. )

All Bibles and books given out as "Bibles", will be scrutinized with the aid of computers during the course of this project to statistically, linguistically prove that God's Word is consistent in all languages and versions to a society that is dependent on scientific proof. Therefore if any version is found inconsistent with the Word of God, we as the Christians Community will not regard the writing as the Word of God.

If you fear that the version you or your company has published is not consistent with the Word of God, repent. Ask God for forgiveness. We do not have any further advice at this moment. Revelation 22: 18 - 19
